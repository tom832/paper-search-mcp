## Overview

`paper-search-mcp` is a Python-based MCP server that enables users to search and download academic papers from various platforms. It provides tools for searching papers (e.g., `search_arxiv`) and downloading PDFs (e.g., `download_arxiv`), making it ideal for researchers and AI-driven workflows. Built with the MCP Python SDK, it integrates seamlessly with LLM clients like Claude Desktop.

---

## Features

- **Multi-Source Support**: Search and download papers from arXiv, PubMed, bioRxiv, medRxiv, Google Scholar, IACR ePrint Archive, Semantic Scholar.
- **Standardized Output**: Papers are returned in a consistent dictionary format via the `Paper` class.
- **Asynchronous Tools**: Efficiently handles network requests using `httpx`.
- **MCP Integration**: Compatible with MCP clients for LLM context enhancement.
- **🔐 API Key Authentication**: ✅ **WORKING** - Secure access control with configurable API key authentication using FastMCP's built-in middleware.
- **Extensible Design**: Easily add new academic platforms by extending the `academic_platforms` module.

## Installation

`paper-search-mcp` can be installed using `uv` or `pip`. Below are two approaches: a quick start for immediate use and a detailed setup for development.

### Installing via Smithery

To install paper-search-mcp for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@openags/paper-search-mcp):

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install @openags/paper-search-mcp --client claude
```

### Quick Start

For users who want to quickly run the server:

1. **Install Package**:

   ```bash
   uv add paper-search-mcp
   ```

2. **Configure Claude Desktop**:
   Add this configuration to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (Mac) or `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` (Windows):
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "paper_search_server": {
         "command": "uv",
         "args": [
           "run",
           "--directory",
           "/path/to/your/paper-search-mcp",
           "-m",
           "paper_search_mcp.server"
         ],
         "env": {
           "SEMANTIC_SCHOLAR_API_KEY": "" // Optional: For enhanced Semantic Scholar features
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```
   > Note: Replace `/path/to/your/paper-search-mcp` with your actual installation path.

### For Development

For developers who want to modify the code or contribute:

1. **Setup Environment**:

   ```bash
   # Install uv if not installed
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

   # Clone repository
   git clone https://github.com/openags/paper-search-mcp.git
   cd paper-search-mcp

   # Create and activate virtual environment
   uv venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   # Install project in editable mode
   uv add -e .

   # Add development dependencies (optional)
   uv add pytest flake8
   ```

---

## Authentication

```bash
# 1. Start server without authentication
cd /home/zxhuang/mcp-agent/paper-search-mcp
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m paper_search_mcp.server

# 2. Test with authentication (Ctrl+C to stop server, then restart)
export PAPER_SEARCH_API_KEY="test-key-123"
python -m paper_search_mcp.server

```
